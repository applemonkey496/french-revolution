                <h2>Napoleon Bonaparte</h2>
                <p>
                    Napoleon grew up in Corsica, a French island off the Italian coast. Growing up, he spoke Corsican and Italian, and was bullied for his accent when speaking French. As a kid, he was also quite small, however as an adult he was actually average height at 5 foot 7. He got into a military academy, and in 1785 joined the army. He gained reputation, and by 1793 he was a general for the Committee for Public Safety. Leading up to his coup in 1799, he also secured many victories for the French army. In 1796, the French under Napoleon entered Italy, leading to the concession of Sardinia, and in 1798, Napoleon led the French to Egypt, which they held until 1799. Upon returning, he overthrew the Directory, marking the end to the French Revolution. He declared himself First Consul, and would later become Emperor in 1804. Under Napoleon’s commandment, between 1804 and 1812 the French conquered the Holy Roman Empire (Austria) and Prussia. They also beat Russian forces as well. In 1812 Napoleon was still set on conquering all of Russia, but after a failed expedition, the French forces were severely depleted and many of the conquered countries under the French Empire rebelled, reducing France’s territory to what it is today. Napoleon was then exiled to the island of Elba in 1814. He escaped Elba in 1815 and tried to reclaim his power, but eventually surrendered at the famous Battle of Waterloo. He was then exiled to the island of St. Helena, where he remained until his death in 1821. In his time, Napoleon did greatly improve the educational and legal systems in France and across the French Empire, while it lasted. He was also an unrivaled military genius. Nevertheless, he was still a dictator: the French Empire he created was in many ways a police state, the Napoleonic Code of Laws he implemented was very degrading to women (giving them less rights than even under Louis XVI), and he had his enemies exiled or killed.

                <h2>Louis XVI</h2>
                <p>
                    King Louis XVI was born on August 23rd, 1754, in the Palace of Versailles. King Louis XVI was the king of France from 1774 to 1792, he ruled for eighteen years. He married fourteen year old Marie Antoinette at age fifteen. Louis grew up strong and healthy, although he was very shy. He inherited the throne at a very young age after his father, King Louis XV. Since he was young when he became the king of France, he was incompetent and he lacked the vital skills necessary to govern a country. His poor decisions primarily contributed to the food shortages and financial crisis that France was facing while Louis XVI was the King. When the National Assembly overthrew the monarchy, Louis was executed by guillotine for treason in 1793. In many ways, King Louis XVI brought the French revolution upon himself, and he was one of the key figures before and during the French revolution.
