                The feudal system that was a predominant system of governance in Europe’s Middle Ages was becoming obsolete. There was a growing group of rich commoners, known as the bourgeoisie, who wanted more political power. The peasants were also more educated and had more money, but still lacked many rights. In Europe, the mortality rate had dropped significantly due to better living conditions, and so the population increased a lot. France had over 25 million people, the largest country in Europe at the time, and thus faced food shortages. Also, the many wars of the 1700s—especially France funding the American Revolution—required the monarchy to charge more taxes.
            </p>
            <p>
                The monarchy wanted to raise taxes on the privileged classes (who previously payed little to no taxes), however they didn’t want to take responsibility for this, however, and so they called the Estates-General to decide. It was an assembly that hadn’t met in over 150 years, representing the three “estates”: the first estate, the clergy (Church ministers, etc.), the second estate, the nobility, aristocracy, and third estate, the general population (everyone else). The Estates-General met in May 1789 to discuss these issues.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each estate received one vote, however, so the upper classes (estates one and two) could easily outvote the third estate. Thus, the third estate created their own assembly, which they called the National Assembly. They initially met in a meeting hall, but the government locked the doors, so they were forced to move to an indoor tennis court. There, in the "Tennis Court Oath," they swore to persist until France had a new constitution. Trying to stop this to some extent, Louis XVI asked the nobles and clergy to join this new National Assembly. This became the new legislative body.

                Within the populations, rumours of a conspiracy to overthrow the third estate made the peasants riot in the “Great
                Fear”. In July of 1789, the Parisian citizens stormed the Bastille, a royal prison representing in many ways the
                monarchy’s power. Peasants continued to rise against the noble.

                In August 1789, the National Assembly ruled for the end of the feudal system and the tithe (Church taxes). Later that month, they also decreed the <i>Declaration of Rights of Man and of the Citizen</i>, declaring equality, freedom of speech and religion, among other things. The king, however, refused to back either of those decrees. In October, Parisians marched on the king’s palace in Versailles and brought him back to Paris. To pay off debt, the government of France also decided to give church land to the citizens via a form of bond called an assignat. This mainly benefited the privileged class, because many commoners were not able to buy land. Eventually, these assignats became a form of printed currency, which led to inflation. The National Assembly also divided France into sections which were to be government by elected officials. The justice system was also modified to have elected judges.

                The goal of the aforementioned policies were to create a system in which the king and the people shared power. This would have worked, however Louis XVI did not like this system, and he was feeling very pressured by his advisors among the aristocracy. In June 1791, Louis XVI tried to flee France, but he was caught in Varennes and brought back to Paris.

                The somewhat successful revolution in France gave hope to people living under other absolute monarchical regimes in Europe, and took France as an example that the people could revolt against an authoritarian government. At this point, many of the French nobility fled France to emigrate to other European powers. These powers initially did not pay too much mind to the French revolutionaries, but began to worry when the National Assembly declared that the people had a right to determine their government and laws. Radicals within the revolution declared war on Austria in April 1792, hoping to spread revolutionary ideas. This was also beneficial to Louis XVI, as, by backing this decision, he sought to gain either power by winning, or, by losing, to be saved from the revolution. France suffered from several losses. To add to that, France’s queen, Marie Antoinette, was also Prussian-born, and suggested to her brother, Leopold II, to also join the war in order to stop the revolution. Prussia joined the war in July 1792.
            </p>
            <p>
                The revolutionaries correctly believed that they had been betrayed by the monarchy, and so they imprisoned the royals and the nobility. The French also managed to beat the Prussians on September 20, 1792 at the Battle of Valmy. On the same day, radicals within the revolutionaries created a new assembly called the National Convention. Whereas the previous revolutionaries wanted to create a constitutional monarchy—maintaining a symbolic monarch, but giving the people the power to rule—these radicals wanted to completely abolish the monarchy and create a republic. On the next day, the radicals declared exactly that.

                Within the next year, the government turned the war around and began to win battles. They claimed most of Belgium, and other small territories.
            </p>
            <p>
                Meanwhile, the radicals were divided into two factions: the Montagnards, also known as the Jacobins, and the Girondins. The Girondins wanted to spread the revolution to the rest of Europe, and the Jacobins wanted to, within France, give more power to the lower classes. The Jacobins, led by Maximilien Robespierre, also wanted to execute the royal family, and won that vote by a narrow margin. On January 21, 1793, Louis XVI was executed via guillotine, and Marie Antoinette was executed nine months later. In addition, the radicals even implemented a new “revolutionary calendar,” with 100 second minutes, 100 minute hours, and 10 hour days.
            </p>
            <p>
                In spring 1793, the French began to lose more battles. They conceded Belgium to the newly formed “First Coalition,” composed of Austria, Prussia, Britain, and other European powers.  Now they were under high pressure to win the war, and because of this pressure, people put more faith in the radicals. The Jacobins drove the Girondins out from the National Convention and introduced several radical policies. The Jacobins’ policies included government control of market prices, taxing the rich, government assistance to the disabled and poor, and free and mandatory education. These were some of the first left-wing social policies to be implemented by governments, and they were radical ideas at the time. Due to this, there were many uprisings throughout the Jacobins’ rule, which lasted until July 1794. Although the Jacobins did implement many revolutionary policies such as social security systems and free education, there were many other issues with their rule, which is why it was named the “Reign of Terror.” Because France was cornered in the war by almost all of Europe, and had uprisings within their own country, the Jacobins created a “Committee of Public Safety,” led by Maximilien Robespierre. Despite it being for “public safety,” this committee gave Robespierre dictator-like powers and created extremely harsh consequences for anyone suspected to be against the revolution. This led to the executions of over 15,000 people and the arrest of over 300,000, many without a proper trial. Despite this inquisition, the government also managed to raise an army of over one million people.

                With this army, in June 1794, France reclaimed Belgium from the Austrians at the Battle of Fleurus. France’s victories in the war made Robespierre’s harsh policies unnecessary. The National Convention overthrew Robespierre on July 27, and Robespierre was executed July 28. The Jacobins’ social and economic policies were abolished, and the government stopped any efforts to create economic equality.

                The Jacobins’ social and economic policies were abolished, and the government stopped any efforts to create economic equality. A “White Terror” ensued, with royalists and those against the Jacobins’ rule killing Jacobins and those associated with the party. Citizens revolted in Paris on October 5, 1795, and had to be put down by the military. The military containment was led by the rising general Napoleon Bonaparte.
            </p>
            <p>
                The National Convention created a new constitution removing itself as the ruling body, and placing power in a Directory of five people and two legislative chambers, together forming the “Corps Législatif,” or “legislative body.”

                Meanwhile, the French army continued to win battles. They continued on to claim Holland, after which Holland, Prussia, and Spain made peace with France and exited the war. The French, led by Napoleon, also entered Italy in 1796, causing Sardinia to give in as well. In 1797, Austria also came to a peace agreement. The countries now occupied by France became “sister republics,” with similar governments as the new France. The wars were not over, however. The Directory wanted to spread the revolution across Europe, and also claimed Switzerland and other parts of Italy. France still remained at war with Britain, however, and so, unable to attack England directly, intended to cut off Britain's access to India by seizing Egypt. They held Egypt for some time, but eventually had to concede to the British and Egyptian armies in 1799, when Napoleon and his army returned to France. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Upon returning, in November 1799, Napoleon led a coup to overthrow the Directory, declaring himself First Consul of France. Thus, the revolution was over: France had gone all the way from authoritarianism to republic to authoritarianism.
