            <h3>The Catholic Church</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The Catholic Church had a lot of political power prior to the French revolution, however, during the revolution they were attacked because they heavily taxed those living on their lands, and they were so wealthy and powerful.
                </li>
                <li>
                    During the revolution, the clergy suffered, and thousands of priests were killed or exiled, land ownership changed, and the Church lost their lands, wealth, and political power. This was one of the long term impacts of the French revolution.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There was more freedom for people to practice different religions and faiths in France, since the revolution brought freedom to worship other religions.
                </li>
            </ul>

                The Catholic Church was extremely powerful in France, and they were very wealthy. This is because they taxed citizens living on their lands and properties. The Catholic Church was attacked during the French revolution because they taxed people heavily who were living on their lands, and they treated priests poorly. The priests also resented the wealth and arrogance of their superiors (leaders of the Church). The citizens wanted to overthrow the Catholic Church because it was so powerful and wealthy, in order to dechristianize France. During the French revolution, the clergy suffered, and thousands of priests were exiled or killed. Also, the French government nationalized and sold Church lands as bonds in the form of <i>assignats</i>, which even became a form of paper currency. So, the Church lost their lands, wealth, and political power. This was one of the major long term impacts of the Revolution on the Church. Another long term impact of the revolution on the religious aspect of France was that the Revolution brought freedom of worship to other religions in France, specifically, the French Protestants and the Jews. This overall led to more freedom for people to practice different faiths and religions.

            <h3>Liberalism</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The French revolution significantly changed the social and political structure of France as the feudal system was abolished.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The feudal system was abolished because the feudal system laws were not being enforced, and the system had become ineffective. The National Assembly then issued a report that stated that feudal dues and taxes would be extinct, thereby eliminating the feudal system in France. This was a major long term impact of the French revolution. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    After the National Assembly officially abolished the feudal system, a new, more democratic system was created.
                </li>
                <li>
                    This new system had a major benefit of allowing citizens to have more liberty, rights, and freedom. French peoples were no longer confined by their role in the feudal system, and their individual rights were promoted. This was another long term impact of the French revolution.
                </li>

                The French Revolution significantly changed the social and political structure of France. This was because it abolished the feudal system, and it put an end to the French monarchy. These two key events resulted in liberalism across France. The abolition of the feudal system took place on August 4th, 1789, which was the day of the famous gathering of the National Assembly. They issued a report that declared that the taxes and feudal dues were to be extinct. The feudal system laws were not enforced, and this caused people to not abide by the rules. As a result, the system became ineffective. The magistrates were also without authority; which meant that authority figures within the feudal system lost their power. After the National Assembly officially abolished the feudal system, they developed a new system that more closely resembled the way modern day society is run. There were nineteen governing principles called Articles that outlined how French society would run. Article 10 stated that “All citizens, without distinction of birth, are eligible to any office or dignity, whether ecclesiastical, civil, or military; and no profession shall imply any derogation.” This is showing that anyone can hold a position of power (a government role) within society. This is an example of how after the feudal system was no longer the dominant system in French society, and was no longer the dominant system in French society as people were no longer separated into groups of social status like peasants and nobles. In the new system, there was a shift towards liberalism in French society, which means that citizens have more equality, rights, and freedom. Article 10 from the National Assembly is an example of how citizens have more freedom to choose what their jobs are. They are not confined by their role in the feudal system, instead individual rights were promoted and citizens were able to have more freedom within society. There was also more equality due to the abolition of feudalism as anyone from any class can hold a position of power within French society.

            <h3>Inspiring revolutions in other countries</h3>
            <p>
                The French Revolution impacted other countries by inspiring other revolutions in other countries. In particular, the French revolution inspired revolutions against monarchies in Europe, and revolutions against colonial rule. Political revolutions in the rest of Europe began with the French Revolution. The French revolution influenced people in other European countries, and it caused people to fight against the authority of kings. The French revolution also influenced revolutions in other parts of the world. For example, the French revolution sparked the Haitian Revolution of 1791, as Haiti had an oppressive government at the time as well. It also inspired the Irish Rebellion of 1798, and the revolutionary wars in Latin America. These countries' citizens were inspired by the idea of liberty, and revolutionaries fought to overthrow the aristocratic and colonial rule that was controlling countries at the time. These revolutions across the world lead to the establishment of a significant number of democracies. Other revolutions also brought liberalism to countries, and it ended feudal and traditional laws and practices. These changes benefited those societies because there was a shift from old ways of governing society to a new way of governing which was more developed, and beneficial for the citizens.
