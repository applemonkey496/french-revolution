                Brinton’s stages of Revolution can directly apply to the French revolution. Specifically, for the preliminary stage of the cycle, one of the characteristics was intellectuals transferring loyalty. This is because when the Estates-General had been called shortly before the revolution had begun, the political system fell due to members of the Third Estate removing themselves from the system. Those members of the Third Estate (the commoners) then formed the national assembly which was a revolutionary assembly. The national assembly was first formed by the commoners, and gradually after, they were joined by some of the nobles and the majority of the clergy, and other people such as peasants. The reason why the nobles and the clergy joined the national assembly was because many members of that class believed that their privileges were unjust and harmful to society, as they were not being taxed, but the poor were being taxed. This significant action of breaking away from the Estates-General system, and forming the national assembly was an act of the French citizens changing their loyalties from the class/estates system to a revolutionary system. The French peoples transferred their faithfulness from the monarchy to being loyal to themselves. In addition, this action also applies to the aspect of class antagonisms. This is because the French people opposed the estate/class system. They were angered with the lack of action of the Estates general, and they felt antagonized by the system. The French refused to be taxed unfairly, and they decided to meet separately. The King tried to prevent the national assembly from taking action to improve French society. Overall, there were severe conflicts and antagonisms between the King and the national assembly, as well as conflicts between the Estate system, and the National Assembly. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Another way that the French revolution connected to the aspect of intellectuals transferring loyalty was because of the way that philosophers used enlightenment to convince people to not trust the monarchy. The Enlightenment was driven by a group of philosophers who shared the belief that existing government systems were harming people and limiting their capabilities. They had the motive to improve society through reasoning and scientific thinking. Their ideas and reasoning caused French citizens to also question Louis XVI’s ability to rule, as well as the necessity of a monarchy. The movement made French peoples transfer their loyalties away from the French monarchy system, and towards a different form of government.
            </p>
            <p>
                The French revolution also applies to the aspect of government inefficiency. The French government/monarchy was inefficient with money and resources prior to the revolution. While French citizens were starving in Paris due to the food shortage, King Louis was spending thousands of dollars on simple pieces of clothing for himself while the people of France needed support to survive. King Louis’ wife Marie Antoinette was also spending unknown amounts of money on jewels and gold rather than helping French citizens manage the food crisis. King Louis also bought and hoarded large amounts of food including wheat, and he spent thousands of dollars on chocolate while the peasants were starving. Another way that the French government wasted resources was by loaning money to other countries such as the United States, to fund the American revolution. Overall, these actions show how King Louis prioritized himself over the French people, and this directly applies to the characteristic of government efficiency as there are several examples of situations when King Louis wasted resources, money, and time. These reasons also show how King Louis was an inept ruler, meaning that he was an incompetent and unsuitable ruler for France. This is because he made decisions that only benefited him, and not the citizens of France. For example, his choices to buy and hoard expensive food and clothing while France was in a financial crisis show that he was an inconsiderate and inept ruler. In addition, King Louis was unable to impose change during times of crisis for France, and he did not take action to support the French peoples during financial and economic crises. This is another major reason why he was an inept ruler. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Another way that Brinton’s stages of Revolution apply to the French revolution is because of King Louis's failure to use force to prevent the revolution from occurring. After King Louis XVI became aware of the National Assemblies formation, he held a general gathering in which the government attempted to intimidate the Third Estate into cooperating. The National Assembly had grown too strong since citizens and nobles joined the assembly, and as a result the group was accumulating more political power. Parisians had received word about the National Assembly, and that caused revolutionary energy within the city. Citizens of France were inspired by the National Assembly, and they protested and rioted in response to recent government actions, such as rising prices. King Louis XVI feared the violence, and he had troops surround his palace at Versailles. This shows how Louis XVI failed in preventing the French peoples from revolting, instead he chose to protect himself rather than standing up to the citizens and reassuring them to prevent the revolution. King Louis XVI’s actions showed his failure of force to prevent the citizens from forming the National Assembly and becoming more powerful, and he also failed to be forceful in standing up to the rioting and protesting French citizens.

            <h3>Stage 2: First Stage</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    There were three main causes of financial breakdown during the first stage of the French revolution.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Inefficient taxation system did not allow for the government to collect enough money from taxes
                </li>
                <li>
                    France had a large amount of debt from Louis XVI's poor financial decisions, including the financement of the American Revolution.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The honeymoon period during the first stage of the French revolution happened after the Estate system fell, and while the National Assembly was in power, from 1791 to 1793.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After the Estate system fell, there was a honeymoon period for citizens of France because the taxation system was unfair, and citizens would have felt relief and happiness after that system was no longer effective.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The National Assembly had power, and the monarchy was no longer involved in making decisions and managing the crisis. This also caused relief and content amongst citizens. 
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="show-content active"><i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i> More</p>
            <p>
                The French Revolution had a significant dramatic event during the first stage of the revolution, which was the storming of the Bastille Prison in France. The French revolution began when citizens stormed the Bastille prison on July 14th, 1789. The people of Paris knew that the King would use his foreign soldiers against his own people. The citizens of Paris needed gunpowder to protect and defend themselves against their monarchy, so they decided to take the gunpowder stored in the Bastille prison. A group of around a thousand men from the Third Estate participated in the attack. The French peoples were revolting against an oppressive government by storming the prison. This event was dramatic and significant to the revolution because it ushered in the French revolution. The day in history was such a significant turning point of the French Revolution that it is a day that is still celebrated in Paris right now. One of the reasons why the event was significant was because it symbolized the citizens rebelling against the controlling, incompetent, oppressive government.  An example of government protests includes the storming of the Bastille prison. This was a government protest because citizens were objecting and disagreeing with the monarchy by raiding Bastille prison. Although the citizens needed the gunpowder from the prison for protection, the attack was also acting as a symbol of protest against the government. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Financial breakdown is another way that the French revolution applies to Brinton’s stages of revolution. One of the causes of financial breakdown during the French revolution was the inefficient taxation system. Since the Estate system ensured that the Third estate was taxed the most, and the First and Second estates were taxed the least, the poorer citizens were eventually unable to pay taxes to the government, thus meaning that the government was unable to collect enough money from taxes. Another cause of financial breakdown was because of the money that was loaned to the United States to fund the American revolution. This large amount of money that France loaned was never repaid, and it largely contributed to France’s debt. France also went into debt because of selfish decisions made by the monarchs, King Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. Both monarchs were spending large amounts of money on food from other countries like India, and they were spending money on fancy clothing for themselves. This also contributed to France's debt.

            <p>
                The honeymoon period during the first stage of the French revolution happened after the Estate system (old regime) fell, and while the National Assembly was in power. The honeymoon began in 1791, and it ended in 1793. After the Estate system fell, there was a honeymoon period for citizens of France because the taxation system was unfair, and it was causing citizens of the Third estate to become poorer than they already were as they were heavily taxed. The Third estate citizens and peasants would have felt relief, and they would have been more content when the oppressive, and unfair system was no longer effective in French society. In addition, the Third estate citizens would have more hope for potentially regaining some of their wealth and overcoming the financial crisis in the future. Another reason why France had a honeymoon period was because the National Assembly had power, and the monarchy was no longer making decisions and managing the crisis. The National Assembly was primarily composed of the Third estate, and they were more aware of the challenges that the commoners faced, whereas the monarchy was unable to relate to the issues facing the Third estate. This also allowed for reassurance amongst citizens. The National Assembly was able to more successfully work towards solving the crises at hand, for example, the food crisis, and the financial crisis. Although the National Assembly still had these large problems to manage, they were able to improve the current state that France was in. For example, they used the Catholic Church's wealth to improve the food and financial crisis. The National Assembly confiscated all of the church's land and then used it to create a new French currency called the Assignat. The Assignat financed the Revolution, and it allowed for France to begin to rebuild its economy. Citizens were pleased and content with the steps that were being taken by the National Assembly to improve France’s economy. This significantly contributed to the honeymoon period during the first stage of the French revolution.  
            </p>
            <p>
                The formation of the National Assembly was not only a cause of the honeymoon period, it was also a result of moderates gaining power. The moderates within the French revolution were considered members of the Third Estate, or commoners, and they gained power by overthrowing the monarchy and forming a group that had control over the people of France. The moderates attaining power benefited society as it allowed for a peaceful, honeymoon period after the Estate system fell. Also, the National Assembly was able to make more reasonable decisions which allowed for French society to improve on the food and financial crises at hand.

            <h3>Stage 3: Crisis</h3>
            <p>
                Overall, this fits the third stage of Brinton’s model: the radical Jacobins took control, there was a great concentration of power vested in the Committee of Public Safety, led by Maximilien Robespierre, and France continued to be at war with much of Europe.
            </p>
            <p class="show-content active"><i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i> More</p>
            <p>
                The French Revolution aligns with the third stage of Brinton’s model of the revolution in several ways. France was at war with much of Europe: in April 1792, they declared war with Austria, and in July 1792, Prussia joined the war. By spring 1793, most of Europe’s powers were adhered to a coalition against France. Within the revolution, two main groups had developed: the moderate Girondins and the radical Jacobins. Firstly, the radical Jacobins’ ideas became embraced further and further as the revolution went on, and eventually the Jacobins claimed power under Maximilien Robespierre, starting the “Reign of Terror.” Many people revolted, and sometimes even the military had to be called in to quell uprisings. Although in theory France was a republic from 1792 on until Napoleon, in practice it was often not throughout the revolution. During Robespierre and the Jacobins’ rule from 1793 to 1794, Robespierre was given almost dictatorial power under the Big Brother-like Committee for Public Safety, which executed over 15,000 people and jailed over 300,000.

            <h3>Stage 4: Recovery</h3>
            <p>
                In general, the revolution did follow the final stage of Brinton’s model in its return to an absolutist government, however Napoleonic France did not return to less eventful times; it was still ambitious and conquered many European powers.
            </p>
            <p class="show-content active"><i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i> More</p>
            <p>
                In 1799, General Napoleon Bonaparte staged a coup on the Directory and declared himself the First Consul of France. In all but name, Napoleon was now the dictatorial ruler of France. In 1804, Napoleon even went ahead to declare himself Emperor of France. Nevertheless, France was certainly not in for “quieter times.” Napoleon went on to conquer much of the European continent in the following decade. Although the revolution had many long term impacts on human rights, liberty, and even society as a whole, in France, the revolution didn't end in republic.

            <h2 style="margin-top: 10px;">Was it a success?</h2>
            <p>The French Revolution was a long term success, but not a short term success because:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The government went back to absolutism at the end (Napoleon).</li>
                <li>However, less power was given to the Church.</li>
                <li>The citizens were not happier under Napoleon.</li>
                <li>The revolution spread the ideas of human rights within Europe and the world and inspired other revolts.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This is based on the following criteria for success:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Did the citizens get more freedom and rights?</li>
                <li>Was political power from the people, instead of being vested in a select group?</li>
                <li>Did the government structure change?</li>
                <li>Did it have a lasting impact within the country and in other countries?</li>
                <li>Were the citizens happier?</li>
                <li>Did it improve society?</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="show-content active"><i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i> More</p>
            <p>
                Firstly, the revolution balanced power away from the Catholic Church. The Catholic Church was extremely powerful in France, and they were very wealthy prior to the French revolution. However, the Catholic Church was attacked during the French revolution, and they lost their lands, wealth, and political power. This is one way that the political power became more balanced as a result of the French revolution, meeting this criterion for a successful revolution. On the other hand, when Napoleon came to power after the revolution, governmental power was no longer balanced in the way that it was with the National Assembly. Napoleon created an authoritarian regime not too different than Louis XVI's rule. Thus, in the short term, France's government did not change very much as a result of the revolution. As a counterpoint, Napleon did improve several things during his reign: he got France out of debt and improved the taxation system. In the long term, power was diverted away from the Catholic Church, which overall led to greater freedom of religious worship in France. In the sense of balance of power, the French revolution was a short term failure and a long term success.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the revolution, the feudal system was abolished which paved the way for more rights and freedoms for citizens. After the National Assembly officially abolished the feudal system due to its ineffectiveness and after feudal laws were not being enforced, they developed a new system that more closely resembled the way modern day society is run. This new system had a major benefit of allowing citizens to have more liberty, rights, and freedom. French peoples were no longer confined by their role in the feudal system, and their individual rights were promoted. Abolishing the feudal system also meant that people were no longer separated into groups of social status like peasants and nobles. In the new system, there was a shift towards liberalism in French society, which means that citizens have more equality, rights, and freedom. This directly applies to the criterion of citizens gaining more freedom and rights. Although republic government of the National Assembly didn't last, the abolition of the feudal system did last, which was beneficial to French citizens in the short and long term.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another reason why the French revolution was a success was because the French citizens were more content and at peace when the monarchy was overthrown, and when the National Assembly was in power, for the short time that it lasted. This was because after the estate system fell, citizens were relieved as the estate system caused them to become poorer due to heavy taxes. Third estate citizens would have also had more hope for potentially regaining some of their wealth and overcoming the financial crisis in the future. In addition, the National Assembly was able to make better decisions to manage the crises in France because the National Assembly was primarily composed of the Third estate, and they were more aware of the challenges that the commoners faced. This also caused citizens to be more satisfied with the new albeit temporary form of government. These reasons apply to the revolution success criterion of citizens being more content with the new ruler/form of government. (However, after the revolution, Napoleon came to power, who did not embrace such ideals of freedom. Nevertheless, the citizens were happy for the short period with the National Assembly.)
            </p>
            <p>
                During the French revolution, the <i>Declaration of Rights of Man and the Citizen</i> was legislated. It was one of the very first human rights documents, and it led to human rights becoming increasingly important after the revolution. Other revolutions across the world were inspired by the ideas of freedom and democracy embodied by the French revolution. This was another long term success for the French revolution.
