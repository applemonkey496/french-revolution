            <p>
                Overall, this fits the third stage of Brinton’s model: the radical Jacobins took control, there was a great concentration of power vested in the Committee of Public Safety, led by Maximilien Robespierre, and France continued to be at war with much of Europe.

                The French Revolution aligns with the third stage of Brinton’s model of the revolution in several ways. France was at war with much of Europe: in April 1792, they declared war with Austria, and in July 1792, Prussia joined the war. By spring 1793, most of Europe’s powers were adhered to a coalition against France. Within the revolution, two main groups had developed: the moderate Girondins and the radical Jacobins. Firstly, the radical Jacobins’ ideas became embraced further and further as the revolution went on, and eventually the Jacobins claimed power under Maximilien Robespierre, starting the “Reign of Terror.” Many people revolted, and sometimes even the military had to be called in to quell uprisings. Although in theory France was a republic from 1792 on until Napoleon, in practice it was often not throughout the revolution. During Robespierre and the Jacobins’ rule from 1793 to 1794, Robespierre was given almost dictatorial power under the Big Brother-like Committee for Public Safety, which executed over 15,000 people and jailed over 300,000.
